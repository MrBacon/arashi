New ActionResult Types : MVC 3 includes three new ActionResult types and helper methods:
1. HttpNotFoundResult – indicates that a resource which was requested by the current URL was not found. HttpNotFoundResult will return a 404 HTTP status code to the calling client.
2. PermanentRedirects – The HttpRedirectResult class contains a new Boolean “Permanent” property which is used to indicate that a permanent redirect should be done. Permanent redirects use a HTTP 301 status code.  The Controller class  includes three new methods for performing these permanent redirects: RedirectPermanent(), RedirectToRoutePermanent(), andRedirectToActionPermanent(). All  of these methods will return an instance of the HttpRedirectResult object with the Permanent property set to true.
3. HttpStatusCodeResult – used for setting an explicit response status code and its associated description.

   - STUB: used for state verification: which means that we determine whether the exercised method worked correctly by 
            examining the state of the SUT and its collaborators after the method was exercised.

   - MOCK: used for behavior verification to see if the object did the right thing in its interaction with other objects.
